# Full Adder in VHDL
A full adder adds binary numbers and accounts for values carried in as well as out. A one-bit full adder adds three one-bit numbers. The full adder used in this project has x, y, and C_in as three inputs: x and y are the input bits, and C_in is the input carry bit. The two outputs are S (for sum) and C_out (for Carry out).
